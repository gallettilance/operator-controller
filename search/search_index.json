Operators are a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes application. An Operator is composed of one or more controllers paired with one or both of the following objects: * One or more API extensions  * One or more CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs).</p> <p>OLM helped define lifecycles for these extensions: from packaging and distribution to installation, configuration, upgrade, and removal.</p> <p>The first iteration of OLM, termed OLM v0, included several concepts and features targeting the stability, security, and supportability of the life-cycled applications, for instance: * A dependency model that enabled cluster extensions to focus on their primary purpose by delegating out of scope behavior to dependencies * A constraint model that allowed cluster extension developers to define support limitations such as conflicting extensions, and minimum kubernetes versions * A namespace-based multi-tenancy model in lieu of namespace-scoped CRDs * A packaging model in which catalogs of extensions, usually containing the entire version history of each extension, are made available to clusters for cluster users to browse and select from</p> <p>Since its initial release, OLM has helped catalyse the growth of Operators throughout the Kubernetes ecosystem.

If a user is running the resolver, they would be blind to an installed extension that is watching their namespace if they don\u2019t have permission to list extensions in the installation namespace. If a controller is running the resolver, then it might leak information to a user about installed extensions that the user is not otherwise entitled to know. 2. Even if (1) could be overcome, the lack of awareness of watched namespaces means that the resolver would have to make assumptions.

In Kubernetes, API registration is cluster-scoped. It is not possible to register different APIs in different namespaces. Instances of an API can be cluster- or namespace-scoped. All APIs are global (they can be invoked/accessed regardless of namespace). For cluster-scoped APIs, the names of their instances must be unique. For example, it\u2019s possible to have Nodes named \u201cone\u201d and \u201ctwo\u201d, but it\u2019s not possible to have multiple Nodes named \u201ctwo\u201d. For namespace-scoped APIs, the names of their instances must be unique per namespace. The following illustrates this for ConfigMaps, a namespace-scoped API:</p> <p>Allowed - Namespace: test, name: my-configmap - Namespace: other, name: my-configmap</p> <p>Disallowed - Namespace: test, name: my-configmap - Namespace: test, name: my-configmap</p> <p>In cases where OLMv0 decides that joint ownership of CRDs will not impact different tenants, OLMv0 allows multiple installations of bundles that include the same named CRD, and OLMv0 itself manages the CRD lifecycle. This has security implications because it requires OLMv0 to act as a deputy, but it also pits OLM against the limitations of the Kubernetes API. OLMv0 promises that different versions of an operator can be installed in the cluster for use by different tenants without tenants being affected by each other. This is not a promise OLM can make because it is not possible to have multiple versions of the same CRD present on a cluster for different tenants.</p> <p>In OLMv1, we will not design the core APIs and controllers around this promise. Instead, we will build an API where ownership of installed objects is not shared. Managed objects are owned by exactly one extension.</p> <p>This pattern is generic, aligns with the Kubernetes API, and makes multi-tenancy a possibility, but not a guarantee or core concept. We will explore the implications of this design on existing OLMv0 registry+v1 bundles as part of the larger v0 to v1 migration design. For net new content, operator authors that intend multiple installations of operator on the same cluster would need to package their components to account for this ownership rule. Generally, this would entail separation along these lines: - CRDs, conversion webhook workloads, and admission webhook configurations and workloads, APIServices and workloads. - Controller workloads, service accounts, RBAC, etc.</p> <p>OLMv1 will include primitives (e.g. templating) to make it possible to have multiple non-conflicting installations of bundles.</p> <p>However it should be noted that the purpose of these primitives is not to enable multi-tenancy. It is to enable administrators to provide configuration for the installation of an extension. The fact that operators can be packaged as separate bundles and parameterized in a way that permits multiple controller installations is incidental, and not something that OLMv1 will encourage or promote.</p>"},{"location":"olmv1_overview/#make-olm-secure-by-default","title":"Make OLM secure by default","text":"<p>OLMv0 runs as cluster-admin, which is a security concern. OLMv0 has optional security controls for operator installations via the OperatorGroup, which allows a user with permission to create or update them to also set a ServiceAccount that will be used for authorization purposes on operator installations and upgrades in that namespace. If a ServiceAccount is not explicitly specified, OLM\u2019s cluster-admin credentials are used. Another avenue that cluster administrators have is to lock down permissions and usage of the CatalogSource API, disable default catalogs, and provide tenants with custom vetted catalogs. However if a cluster admin is not aware of these options, the default configuration of a cluster results in users with permission to create a Subscription in namespaces that contain an OperatorGroup effectively have cluster-admin, because OLMv0 has unlimited permissions to install any bundle available in the default catalogs and the default community catalog is not vetted for limited RBAC. Because OLMv0 is used to install more RBAC and run arbitrary workloads, there are numerous potential vectors that attackers could exploit.

When unspecified, the latest version available will be installed.Acceptable version ranges are no longer than 64 characters.Version ranges are composed of comma- or space-delimited values and one ormore comparison operators, known as comparison strings. Additionalcomparison strings can be added using the OR operator (||).# Range ComparisonsTo specify a version range, you can use a comparison string like \"&gt;=3.0,&lt;3.6\". When specifying a range, automatic updates will occur within thatrange. The example comparison string means \"install any version greater thanor equal to 3.0.0 but less than 3.6.0.\". It also states intent that if anyupgrades are available within the version range after initial installation,those upgrades should be automatically performed.# Pinned VersionsTo specify an exact version to install you can use a version range that\"pins\" to a specific version. When pinning to a specific version, noautomatic updates will occur. An example of a pinned version range is\"0.6.0\", which means \"only install version 0.6.0 and neverupgrade from this version\".# Basic Comparison OperatorsThe basic comparison operators and their meanings are:  - \"=\", equal (not aliased to an operator)  - \"!=\", not equal  - \"&lt;\", less than  - \"&gt;\", greater than  - \"&gt;=\", greater than OR equal to  - \"&lt;=\", less than OR equal to# Wildcard ComparisonsYou can use the \"x\", \"X\", and \"\" characters as wildcard characters in allcomparison operations.

Some examples:  - \"~1.2.3\" is equivalent to \"&gt;=1.2.3, &lt;1.3.0\"  - \"~1\" and \"~1.x\" is equivalent to \"&gt;=1, &lt;2\"  - \"~2.3\" is equivalent to \"&gt;=2.3, &lt;2.4\"  - \"~1.2.x\" is equivalent to \"&gt;=1.2.0, &lt;1.3.0\"# Major Release ComparisonsYou can use the \"^\" character to make major release comparisons after astable 1.0.0 version is published. If there is no stable version published, // minor versions define the stability level. Some examples:  - \"^1.2.3\" is equivalent to \"&gt;=1.2.3, &lt;2.0.0\"  - \"^1.2.x\" is equivalent to \"&gt;=1.2.0, &lt;2.0.0\"  - \"^2.3\" is equivalent to \"&gt;=2.3, &lt;3\"  - \"^2.x\" is equivalent to \"&gt;=2.0.0, &lt;3\"  - \"^0.2.3\" is equivalent to \"&gt;=0.2.3, &lt;0.3.0\"  - \"^0.2\" is equivalent to \"&gt;=0.2.0, &lt;0.3.0\"  - \"^0.0.3\" is equvalent to \"&gt;=0.0.3, &lt;0.0.4\"  - \"^0.0\" is equivalent to \"&gt;=0.0.0, &lt;0.1.0\"  - \"^0\" is equivalent to \"&gt;=0.0.0, &lt;1.0.0\"# OR ComparisonsYou can use the \"||\" character to represent an OR operation in the versionrange.
